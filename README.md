- [ ] Tell what the city is famous for as well

- [ ] Use ChatGPT to generate a bunch of details about the location and use a voice converter to return the output

- [ ] Provide an option to allow users to explore other places even if they are not at the location

- [ ] Merge maps choosing along with location input

- [ ] When you are in a place, allow users to create their own checklist with different places to visit and check them off when required
